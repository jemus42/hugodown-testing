[**Quick link to plain markdown post**](/posts/2020-06-06-plain/)


```{r setup}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.path = "plots/", # for leaf bundles to work nicely
  cache = TRUE,
  cache.path = "post_cache/", # (for leaf bundles, cache in post directory)
  fig.retina = 2,
  fig.width = 8.5,
  echo = TRUE,
  message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE,
  fig.align = "center",
  out.width = "95%"
)
```

This is a test of {{< pkg "hugodown" >}}.  


## R Code

### Code with/-out Output

```{r}
my_packages <- rownames(installed.packages())
n_packages <- length(my_packages)
```

And some filler text between chunks.

```{r}
n_packages

tail(tibble::enframe(my_packages))
```


### Plots

- The entire chunk is contained in `<pre>` tags :(
- Tabular display of code with line numbers is set in config, but not applied here

```{r a-plot}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE)
```

## Shortcodes

## Inline

Inline shortcode without tweaks: Hello {{< pkg "hugodown" >}}.

Using `blogdown::shortcode` is not well suited in `r blogdown::shortcode("pkg", "hugodown")`-land I think, but that's not really hugodown's fault. The html-preserving comments are inserted with newlines, which might explain this. 

## Block-level

Here's a figure shortcode:

{{< figure src="plots/a-plot-1.png" alt="" caption="" >}}

The same shortcode with `blogdown::shortcode`

`r blogdown::shortcode("figure", src="plots/a-plot-1.png")`

## Footnotes

This is a footnote in `^[inline format]` as used by [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#footnotes) but not supported by [Hugo's Goldmark](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration-markup/#goldmark) ^[Hello there].  

Here's a reference-style footnote [^ref].

[^ref]: Something goldmark and pandoc can agree on.


## Math and stuff

(Rmd: Have not applied fixes to make it work yet)

This is text with inline math $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 2^{-n} = 1$ and with math blocks:

$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 2^{-n} = 1
$$

This repository exists to mimic a very basic version of my blog, using the same theme but without any custom CSS tweaks.

The idea is to have a quick and easy way to see if [hugodown](https://github.com/r-lib/hugodown) works for me or if I'm better off sticking with blogdown + `.Rmarkdown -> .markdown` rendering (which is the case so far).

The blog is auto-deployed to netlify:

- Site: https://hugodown-testing.netlify.app/
- Rmarkdown content testing: https://hugodown-testing.netlify.app/posts/rmarkdown-content/
- Plain markdown content: https://hugodown-testing.netlify.app/posts/2020-06-06-plain/
